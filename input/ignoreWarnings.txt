# Chemical abstract codes (CAS) code system is specified as content 'not-present' in THO, so the code cannot be validated

# MedicinalProductDefinition.characteristic.value[x] is a polymorphic (choice type) element, with allowed types including
# Quantity, CodeableConcept and others.  The only slice defined in the profile is for valueQuantity, but the data in this
# instance is valueCodeableConcept, which is not expected to match the slice definition.
INFORMATION: Bundle/bundle-drug-product-pq-ex1: Bundle.entry[3].resource/*MedicinalProductDefinition/a0694a7a-aafa-4cbe-8135-c788a9a4d3d5*/.characteristic[0].value.ofType(CodeableConcept): This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pharm-quality/StructureDefinition/MedicinalProductDefinition-drug-product-pq|1.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
