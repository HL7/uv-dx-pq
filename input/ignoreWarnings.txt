# The EDQM code system and the 'class' and 'domain' properties that are defined in the EDQM CodeSystem resource are fully supported in tx.fhir.org.  The value sets defined with these properties are being correctly expanded and rendered by the Publisher, so these messages appear to be generated due to an IG Publisher tooling issue.
