# The US NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl) provides reference terminology for many NCI and other systems. It covers vocabulary for clinical care, translational and basic research, and public information and administrative activities. It is not yet listed by the HL7 Terminology Server (http://tx.fhir.org/r4/). It is listed by HL7 Terminology (THO) (https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-v3-nciThesaurus.html), but contains no codes there.
