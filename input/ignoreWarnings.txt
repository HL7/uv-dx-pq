# Information messages about reference to deprecated item: http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction, which is being added by the Publisher to 7 profiles for the following base resources: ActivityDefinition, MedicinalProductDefinition, ObservationDefinition, PackagedProductDefinition, PlanDefinition, SpecimenDefinition, SubstanceDefinition. Recommendation is to ignore it for now (https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/http.3A.2F.2Fhl7.2Eorg.2Ffhir.2FValueSet.2Fjurisdiction.20deprecated.20warnin)

# Chemical abstract codes (CAS) code system is specified as content 'not-present' in THO, so the code cannot be validated.
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/CAS' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# The EDQM code system and the 'class' and 'domain' properties that are defined in the EDQM CodeSystem resource are fully supported in tx.fhir.org. The value sets defined with these properties are being correctly expanded and rendered by the Publisher, so these messages appear to be generated due to an IG Publisher tooling issue.
No definition can be found for the system http://standardterms.edqm.eu, and the property 'class' is not a generally known property, so the property might not be valid, or understood by the terminology ecosystem. In case its useful, the list of generally known properties for all systems is {2}

# This IG contains 8 example codes systems, which are not expected to be moved to THO. The concepts in the code systems are ONLY used to create value sets bound with Example binding strength and the name of each code system ends in the string "Example" to clarify that the code system is only to be used for example bindings and should not be used in production instances (see https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book).
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
