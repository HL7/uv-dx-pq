# Chemical abstract codes (CAS) code system is specified as content 'not-present' in THO, so the code cannot be validated
The definition for the Code System with URI 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/CAS' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# MedicinalProductDefinition.characteristic.value[x] is a polymorphic (choice type) element, with allowed types including
# Quantity, CodeableConcept and others.  The only slice defined in the profile is for valueQuantity, but the data in this
# instance is valueCodeableConcept, which is not expected to match the slice definition.
