CMC data represented by FHIR resources in this IG are organized into 14 domains, as illustrated in the following figure. Each domain has a page that describes its objective and provides a component diagram (where applicable), description of components, typical steps for assembling information, and examples. The examples include links to CMC example documents with synthetic data and HTML renderings of synthetic structured data for the drug product example, as well as links to the appropriate FHIR example file(s) in this implementation guide. The CMC example documents with synthetic data are based on the ICH Common Technical Document (CTD) structure (see Resources [add link] page for references).
