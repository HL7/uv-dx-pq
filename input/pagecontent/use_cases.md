### Scenarios

This IG defines resources to support many scenarios, including the following examples.
1. Manufacturer compiles data required for the first clinical trial application.
1. Manufacturer develops data to justify changes to approved equipment and/or location for a previously authorized drug manufacturing process.
  - Manufacturer already has an authorization to sell a drug. That authorization locks the manufacturer into manufacturing the drug with a specific process, specific equipment, and at a specific location.
  - Manufacturer wants to change the type of milling machine used in the drug manufacturing process.
  - Manufacturer must first obtain health authority approval before making the equipment change. Approval is obtained by filing a regulatory application to the health authority.
  - Manufacturer authors the supporting documents needed to justify the change to the health authority (Depending on the type of change, and the health authority, the application contains 10’s to 1,000’s of Word and PDF documents).
  - Manufacturer bundles the supporting documents into an application and submits it to the health authority for review. Health authority issues an approval or rejection.
