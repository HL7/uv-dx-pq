### Best Practices
**Support Accessability**

The authors of this guide recommend that user interface applications implementing this specification include alternative text descriptions of images and other accessibility standards, such as those  described in:
- U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), [https://www.section508.gov/](https://www.section508.gov/)
- W3C, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (or latest version)

**Assembling Bundle Components**
Typical steps to assembling information for a FHIR Bundle, for example a Stability Study are:
1. Select Ingredients
1. Select Substances
1. Select Medicinal Product
1. Select individual tests and acceptance criteria
1. Select storage conditions
1. Populate stability study details
1. Select Batch references
1. Populate test results
1. Populate final report with conclusions

Assembling FHIR Bundles for other domains follows similar steps.
